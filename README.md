# Project Name: Max Fosh's Loophole Tour revamp

Essentially it is just revamping a YouTuber Loophole Tour website. He is a british comedian on YouTube that had accumulated over 4.3 million subscribers. He is a YouTuber that I watch so I know about his tour but have not visited the website till now. I checked out his website and it is a one-page website that had all the information clumped up in one page. When I checked it on mobile, the design of his website actually looked pretty bad as compared to the laptop version. Therefore, I feel that I can do a better job and decided to revamp it.
## Design process

The website is used by his subscribers/ followers and people who likes to watch comedic stuff. The main objective of the website to get people to buy the ticket to the show. The following functions are needed:
- As a user, I want to be able to purchase a ticket
- As a user, I want a form of contact if I have any enquiries or problems
- As a user, I want to find out more about the guy doing the tour (if I have not seen him before)

## Features

### Existing Features

- Social Media Links
- Function of buying tickets
- Ability to send emails
### Features to add

- Info to know more about Max Fosh
### Features I am removing

- Ability to send emails, reason being: Most of Max Fosh viewers are teenagers and adults. That demographic of people uses social media more often hence having an email feature seems redundant as they would just send enquiries and problems that they encountered through the various social media platform.
## Technology used

- w3schools.com for the various css codes for flexbox etc.
- stackflow.com for more css codes that I couldnt find on w3schools.com
## Note

**All links lead to actual websites in the original website meaning the ticket is legit if you actually click buy on the website it send you to after you click "buy" on my website.** Background picture taken from original website. I was trying to match his branding colours which is basically like pink so I tried to make all the colours like pink-ish and red-ish since pink is just like a lighter shade of red. That probably explains why my colour scheme for the websites are not actually that good. For the text colours, I tried to make it a contrasting colour as compared to its surrounding boxes etc. 

*The tickets listed in my website was based off of the date before submission and it is not created by javascript hence it would not automatically remove the ticket after the date had passed. I also did not put my css and html into respective folders as I do not know how to retrieve the directory for the css for my html and the background picture in the picture folder for my css.*
## Testing

Every links seem to working fine. Ticketing links may be wrong as I might copy the wrong url. The facebook page is not working as the original one also didnt work. Everything else also seems to be working fine. I do not know how to make the background scalable to the different devices.

I wanted the home page picture and and paragraph text beside it to split into 2 on mobile view but for some reason, I cannot get that to work so that part is not really that responsive as I want it to. Other than that, the texts are responsive, it changes based on the size of the screen. I don't know if the font style works as I kind of forgot how to do it so I only know that the first font works, I don't know about the rest.

*I do not know why but VScode and the css checker is giving me warnings for normalize.css when I did not even touch it.*
